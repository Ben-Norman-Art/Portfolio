<p style="color:white"> The art pieces represent some of the emotions and activities I go through while in quarantine. This past year with COVID spreading this pandemic made these many months feel like a glitch in everyone lives. People are not feeling like themselves anymore before the pandemic started and they feel like a glitch because they are unable to accept that changes that they will have to endure until there gltiched life is fixed. 
    
I made these pieces using some of my black and white photos I took and converted them into BPM files. I would then import the files into the audio application Audacity and made the file echo and reverbed them.
