<p style="color:white">Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Benjamin Norman, in my Portfolio you will see a variety of pieces that best represent me and the work that I would like to focus on, specifically 3D-Modeling. I want to use these skills to go towards my goal of focusing on Game Design. My primary choice of going down the path of becoming a Game Designer is due to my passion of using the 3D world to bring something into a sense of reality. There is also the interactive aspect that I want to move forward in. It’s one thing to see a 3D model and observe it but it’s another to actually be able to interact with it and see the world or object within the 3D world.

With 3D models being my primary focus, I would also like to pursue many other forms of media such as video editing. There is so much a person can do to give out their message when it comes to a video. When it comes to videos, there is a trifecta for how a video can be perceived. Videos can be made either for Documentation, Entertainment, or Education. These three factors are the main factors when people make videos. And I want to show that these three will always be entwined.

Most of my work is inspired by the different pop culture media that I grew up with, as well as some of my most recent pieces which are inspired by my fellow classmates and our struggle together during these times. This includes many different aspects of Game Design, Cartoon animations and interactive websites. Growing during a time with such diversity in digital media has influenced so many different people and artists to pursue this path. I am one of those artists that is going down this path.
